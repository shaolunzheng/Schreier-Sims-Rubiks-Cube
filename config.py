# a global dictionary containing the shortest computed length of all moves that were considered during Schreier-Sims
# length means length if written as composition of original generators
# the length may not be optimal (and most of the time won't) be
# remark: the shortest solving algorithm for any configuration on 3x3x3 is less than 20 moves (God's number)
